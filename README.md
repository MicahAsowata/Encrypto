# Encrypto
It is a program that can be used to encrypt any piece of text in seconds.

## How to use it
### Prequisites
 Go Compiler (v1.19) was used to build the project
 
    Use the command below to check if you have it installed on your system:
    
    ```
    go version
    ```
    
    If it is the output should be something like this:
    
    ```    
     go version go1.19.1 linux/amd64
     
     ```
     
     Else you can download it [here](https://go.dev/dl/)
     
- Terminal Or Command Prompt
    ```
     mkdir Encypto
     cd Encrypto
     ```
- Clone the project
- Build the file into an executable
    ```
     go build main.go encrypto.go
     ```
- Run the executable
    ```
     ./main
     ```


Follow the prompts where it leads.

But note, any character that is not in the alphabet slice and that is not a space would be rendered as a dot.
