# Encrypto
It is an encryption program written entirely in Go.

How to use it

- Go Compiler (v1.19) was used to build the project

    Use the command 
    
      `go version`
      
    to check. Output should be something like:
    
      `go version go1.19.1 linux/amd64`
      
- Terminal Or Command Prompt

    `mkdir Encypto`
    
    `cd Encrypto`
    
- Clone the project
- Build the file into an executable

    `go build main.go encrypto.go`
    
- Run the executable
- 
    ` ./main`


Follow the prompts where it leads.

But note, any character that is not in the alphabet slice and that is not a space would be rendered as a dot.
